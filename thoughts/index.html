          <h1 class="cover-heading">Thoughts</h1><p>Here are some thoughts I had while coming up with this game.</p>
<h3 id="how-pervasive-should-it-be-really-">How pervasive should it be, really?</h3>
<ul>
<li>playable in one sitting (~30-60 mins)<ul>
<li>more room for specific tooling, costume, pieces</li>
<li>can take full concentration<ul>
<li>but is this better? less like surveillance irl ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>durational [a la assassin]<ul>
<li>more room for emergent intrigue</li>
<li>probably less simple; probably worse<ul>
<li>but it can&#39;t really depend on any outside objects if it&#39;s meant to go on for <code>time</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>harder to get participation, maybe?<ul>
<li>unless it&#39;s joinable at any time; see enough ppl playing and you&#39;ll start urself<ul>
<li>&quot;you lost the game&quot;-game</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>can&#39;t have meaningful score tracking <em>no one can be trusted</em></li>
<li>can&#39;t have roles<ul>
<li>at least not permanent ones, there&#39;s no way to ensure people won&#39;t lie // flip flop</li>
<li>maybe temporary roles enforced by some type of physical state<ul>
<li>maybe geographic, like <code>base</code> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(game">tag</a>#Base_and_truce_terms)</li>
<li>maybe temporary, like <code>it</code> in tag<ul>
<li>but if the game is geographically pervasive [[played in more than one place simultaneously]] it can&#39;t rely on there being &quot;one&quot; it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>games like <code>the game</code> and <code>birdman fancyman</code> succeed, because there&#39;s extremely low overhead if you might be the only player in the room.<ul>
<li>the game is cool, because you don&#39;t have to do anything outwardly visible to be playing. If you lose, you can casually say &quot;I lost the game&quot; and it&#39;s fine if nobody knows what you mean.</li>
<li>in <code>birdman fancyman</code> you&#39;ll never throw up the bird goggles without a target in mind. If there are two players in a group, their play will introduce the other players. Even if it hasn&#39;t come up recently, if you see a known player you&#39;ll keep watch.. If there&#39;s one player in the group, the game will never come up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="on-one-hand">on one hand</h4>
<p>Surveilance is everywhere â€” you can&#39;t turn it off. If I make the game ongoing (birdman fancyman, &#39;the game&#39;), it reflects that quality of surveillance. The classic ongoing games are very simple because they can&#39;t rely on anything that isn&#39;t everywhere, you only need to be present. In 2015, though, every person comes with a small computer (phone). Relying on technology is a slippery slope, though: the game can&#39;t depend on a particular app or website, only something more fundamental.</p>
<h5 id="list-of-technologies-that-will-be-everywhere-forever-">List of technologies that will be everywhere forever:</h5>
<ul>
<li>image-capture</li>
<li>audio recording</li>
<li>internet? (opposed to www)<ul>
<li>maybe premature? the train?</li>
<li>a game that included the internet would have to also include the possibility of no-internet.<ul>
<li>should it be &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; to be offline<ul>
<li>both! more offense less defense.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>light source?<ul>
<li><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><ol>
<li>find someone in the shadows</li>
<li>illuminate them</li>
<li>take a picture<ul>
<li>taking pictures of people in the shadows is creepy. Especially if you don&#39;t know whether they&#39;re playing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>timekeeping</li>
<li><code>infrastructure</code>, as a concept, I guess. This might be out-of-scope, but it&#39;d be kinda cool to make people see something they don&#39;t ordinarily.<ul>
<li>maybe something about spotting existing surveillance devices?</li>
<li>and also using them somehow?</li>
<li>but ideally without dependance on a particular type/model of surveillance</li>
<li><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><ol>
<li>see a camera</li>
<li>see that another player is seen by that camera</li>
<li><em>beat them</em> some type of way<ul>
<li>maybe you <em>hack into the camera</em> [lol] and <em>do something</em> with the image</li>
<li>or, realistically, maybe you take a picture of the camera seeing the person</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>can&#39;t forget: <strong>people!!</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="list-of-technologies-that-are-too-ephemeral-to-use-">List of technologies that are too ephemeral to use:</h5>
<ul>
<li>any particular website // platform // non-infrastructural system<ul>
<li>any particular brand/model of phone, obviously, but beyond that:<ul>
<li>the fact that &quot;phones&quot; are the thing people carry. We certainly won&#39;t move away from connectivity, but &quot;phones&quot; are not forever.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="but-on-the-other">but on the other</h4>
<p>A timeboxed game is waaaaaay easier. I don&#39;t have to rely on it catching on organically. I can declare when and where it will be played, and provide necessary support.</p>
<p>I can have materials, costumes, and best-of-all, <em>complete focus</em> from the players. For the hour that you&#39;re playing, it&#39;s the thing you&#39;re doing and you won&#39;t get distracted. An ongoing game is easy to forget.</p>
<h3 id="mechanics">mechanics</h3>
<ul>
<li>surveillance<ul>
<li>data gathering<ul>
<li>photography</li>
<li>observation</li>
<li>listening<ul>
<li>remote?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>social media</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>analysis<ul>
<li>collaboration between surveillors<ul>
<li>but frought; maybe construct an iterated prisoner&#39;s dillema over the course of the game</li>
<li>sharing information gives the other surveillors a leg up but reveals info // vulnerability</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>gamification<ul>
<li>is it too meta for a game to reference the increasing ubiquity/expanding-definition of games?</li>
<li>what would that even mean?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>coversion<ul>
<li>disguise</li>
<li>sneakitude</li>
<li>misinformation ??<ul>
<li>through the collaborative framework but how else?<ul>
<li>social media!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>false pictures?</li>
<li>implicity?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>nobody wins</em><ul>
<li>except maybe a secretly OP <code>nsa</code> player<ul>
<li>how else to represent gov?</li>
<li>or maybe <code>facebook</code> player can see all online crosstalk but can&#39;t move irl</li>
<li><strong>but a durational game can&#39;t have discreet player roles.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>nomic element?<ul>
<li>could represent the <code>wildcard</code> power of technology</li>
<li>probably makes the game unnecessarily complex</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://ludocity.org/wiki/Privacy_Is_Dead">privacy is dead</a> incorporates trading misinformation, bluffing, and no ordained strategy. Fails because of the trivial prechosen data.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludocity.org/wiki/Double_Agent_/_Watch_Your_Back">double agent / watch your back</a> totally nails the doubt around whom you can trust. Any team mate could be bluffing.</p>

<p><a href="http://ludocity.org/wiki/Paparazzi">paparazzi (sandpit)</a> has better role-playing, with a swarm mentality rather than small teams. The feeling of being stalked is more pervasive.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bird-Man+%5Bthe+game%5D">birdman fancyman</a> uses rules that rhyme to help the game maintain consistancy country-wide. induces a constant feeling of fear, but makes you avoid looking at people rather than surveil them per se. Even so, the birdman role feels kinda surveilly</p>
