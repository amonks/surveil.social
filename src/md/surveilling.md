### Surveilling

*Surveil* the public internet for `#spotted` pictures. If you encounter a player of whom you've collected three `#spotted` pictures, *each taken by a different person* (you can be one of them), approach them and say "You've been surveilled". You must be able to show them the pictures you've collected as proof.

The *surveilled* player must player must take a picture with you and post it on the public internet, tagged `#gotme` and `#socialsurveillance`.
