Surveil takes place in public. Both in public physical space, and on the public internet.

## Starting

To enter the game, post a clear, identifiable picture of yourself on the public internet with the tag `#surveiling`.

You are now playing.

## Playing

You have three objectives:

*   *spot* others
*   *surveil* spottings
*   *avoid* being spotted

### Spotting

If you encounter another player under the watchful gaze of public surveillance infrastructure, take a picture.

Post that picture on the public internet with the tag `#spotted`. Do not tag the victim. The picture must include the surveillance infrastructure and the player being surveilled.

### Surveiling

*Surveil* the public internet for `#spotted` pictures. If you encounter a player and you've collected three `#spotted` pictures of them, *taken by three different people* (you can be one of them), approach them and say `You've been surveilled`. You must be able to show them the pictures you've collected as proof.

The *surveilled* player must player must take a picture with you and post it on the public internet, tagged `#gotme`

### Avoiding

Any time you're on camera, you're liable to get `#spotted`. Be constantly aware of surveilance infrastructure, and avoid its gaze at all costs.
